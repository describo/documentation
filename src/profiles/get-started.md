# Describo Profiles

Describo is driven by profiles. A profile is a set of instructions to the UI to describe how it
should act. Put another way, Describo profiles define what your users can describe.

By default, Describo makes available all of Schema.org. Often times we don't want to expose all of
this to our users so profiles are a way for a community to tell Describo exactly what users are
allowed to describe.

## Profile versions - READ THIS

::: info

If you are writing a profile for Describo Online
[see the documentation with that repository](https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/describo-online/wiki/Writing-a-domain-specific-profile).

This repository describes profiles for the
[Crate Builder Component](https://github.com/describo/crate-builder-component) which are an
evolution of those.

## Domain Specific profiles

Example profiles from specific domains can be seen in the
[domain profiles folder](https://github.com/describo/profiles/tree/master/domain-profiles). If you'd
like to publish your own profile for others to work with or use please submit a pull request to this
repository. You must:

-   create a folder preferably named by your domain in the `domain-profiles` folder.
-   name your profiles in there in some sensible way.

Optionally, add a README to your folder - absolutely recommended but not an essential requirement.
