Because of this, there are many capabilities that are impossible to implement in environments like that.</p><p>Typically, a web application is the &#39;client&#39; part of a client/ server application. This is known as a SAAS (Software as a Service) application. Whilst a SAAS application can do all of the things Desktop can do, it requires the operation of central services (virtual machines and cloud resources) that are out of reach of an unfunded project like Describo. Further, SAAS applications depend upon user management and managing people&#39;s data which is difficult to do securely, and well. The Describo web tool is the client part of a SAAS application without the server part so it has to abide by the restrictions of the browser without the capabilities of the server.</p><p>By contrast, Describo desktop is like a client/server application bundled together. User and user data management is handled by the person&#39;s own computer; that is, they work in their own home directory with their own data. This enables the development of capabilities that couldn&#39;t operate in a standalone browser environment without the complexity of managing users and their data on a server.</p><h2 id="how-do-other-tools-compare-to-describo" tabindex="-1">How do other tools compare to Describo? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-other-tools-compare-to-describo" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do other tools compare to Describo?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Peter Sefton, the original lead of the Describo project, has created an alternative tool using funding from the Language Data Commons of Australia. Whilst it does the same thing as Describo, the internal implementation is quite different.</p><p>Unfortunately, their README is misleading about the differences between it and Describo and over time, they have copied many of the Describo innovations including most recently, making an embeddable component available .</p><p>To address the comment of a &quot;general purpose tool&quot;: Describo is a general purpose tool. As browser environments are extremely limited in what they can do, the web version of Describo is only targetted at simple usage where one wants to browse an RO-Crate. Describo desktop is like a a client / server application all in one and that enables the capabilities coming soon!</p><h2 id="how-do-ro-crate-editor-profiles-compare-to-describo-profiles" tabindex="-1">How do RO-Crate Editor Profiles compare to Describo Profiles? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-ro-crate-editor-profiles-compare-to-describo-profiles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do RO-Crate Editor Profiles compare to Describo Profiles?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In short, they are a limited version of Describo Profiles.</p><p>One of the key innovations of Describo was the development of profiles to drive the user interface. When Marco invented this capability, he designed it so that a profile author could selectively augment schema.org definitions. Consider &#39;Dataset&#39; which is a subclass of &#39;CreativeWork&#39; which is itself a subclass of &#39;Thing&#39;. In all, 133 properties are defined for a Dataset when considering the full entity hierarchy. In Describo, a profile author can define a Dataset class as &#39;inherit&#39; and then add to those properties. In the UI, the user is presented with a control to view all of the available properties along with the extra ones defined in the profile.</p><p>In this way, the profile author does not need to re-define every single one of the properties and overwhelm the user in the interface. Further, with inherit, any properties defined in the profile are made visible in the UI (including any that overlap the schema.org definitions) with the others always available. This allows the profile author complete control over what is shown and how.</p><p>Another difference is how the layouts are defined. In Describo Profiles, the profile author can define their own layouts per entity. Further, the profile author has complete control over how the properties are grouped and what those groups are called. This is not possible with RO-Crate editor profiles.</p><p>Describo profiles have a resolve property where the profile author can define how to resolve complex linking entities like actions. Where an action defines an object, agent and a participant, the profile author can choose to make the linked entities visible in the UI. RO-Crate editor profiles do not have this capability.</p><p>The authors claim that their profiles are no longer compatible with Describo but that is incorrect and misleading. There are elements of their profiles that Describo would ignore but for the most part, the profiles are still compatible even though Describo Profiles are more powerful as they copy the same basic structure.</p><p>Unfortunately, the maintainers chose to not engage with Describo Profiles and when asked why, refused to communicate. <a href="https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/ro-crate-editor-profiles/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/ro-crate-editor-profiles/issues/3</a></p>',20),s=[r];function n(h,l,c,p,d,f){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const b=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
