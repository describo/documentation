Peter, a co-editor of the RO Crate specification, envisaged a tool that would enable users to create valid, spec compliant RO Crates. Initial consultation with his team at UTS and other collaborators led to the creation of the Describo Desktop application.</p><p>In that design, Describo Desktop was required to enable users to describe entities using all of schema.org. As a development on top of that, Marco developed the concept of profiles to drive the user interface. With both of these capabilities Describo Desktop gave users the full power of schema.org whilst also being extensible to custom domains and data models.</p><p>Funded by: <a href="https://uts.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+e+'" alt=""></a></p><h2 id="october-2020-december-2020" tabindex="-1">October 2020 - December 2020 <a class="header-anchor" href="#october-2020-december-2020" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;October 2020 - December 2020&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Whilst very well received and proof of the validity of the concept, the Describo Desktop application had limitations. In a second engagement Peter re-engaged Marco and developed a specification for the Describo Online application. This was a web based version with an internal database to manage entities and the ability to talk to various backend storage systems via rclone. Peter&#39;s vision was to have a singular application that could be deployed as a standalone tool or embed into external applications as the metadata editor. The first integration was to be at UTS.</p><p>In the first iteration Describo Online used Microsoft OneDrive as a backend storage system (via rclone) as this was the preferred data storage system at UTS. In a short development cycle Marco ported the Describo Desktop code to an online environment (Single Page VueJS Application and NodeJS API) and further developed and improved the profile capability of the tool.</p><p>Funded by: <a href="https://uts.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+e+'" alt=""></a></p><h2 id="january-2021-december-2021" tabindex="-1">January 2021 - December 2021 <a class="header-anchor" href="#january-2021-december-2021" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;January 2021 - December 2021&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Throughout 2020 Peter engaged with the EOSC project brokering a consulting engagement for himself and Marco to port the Describo Online environment into their Research Data Management Tool - ScieboRDS.</p><p>Via a few sprints of effort during that year Marco worked with the ScieboRDS developers to help them integrate Describo Online into their tool as the RO Crate description capability. At the same time, Marco integrated Describo Online into the nascent Nyingarn Workspace as the metadata description tool.</p><p>Development that year, with funding from EOSC, WWW Munster and the Nyingarn Project resulted in the integration of S3 and Owncloud backends (also via rclone) and the Reva backend storage systems via the Reva API. Significant experience was gained in operating Describo Online in environments whose requirements varied signifcantly.</p><p>Funded by:</p><div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-around"><a href="https://cs3mesh4eosc.eu" target="_blank" class="bg-black"><img src="'+r+'" class="h-20"></a><a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/" target="_blank"><img src="'+s+'" class="h-32"></a><a href="https://nyingarn.net" target="_blank"><img src="'+t+'" class="h-32"></a></div><h2 id="january-2022" tabindex="-1">January 2022 <a class="header-anchor" href="#january-2022" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;January 2022&quot;">​</a></h2><p>With funding from the Language Data Commons Project (LDACA), Peter asked Marco if he could create a version of Online that users could run on their local machines. With all of Peter&#39;s efforts directed into the Online version, a critical gap existed for users who just wanted a tool to edit RO crates without needing to run a web application. To solve this problem Marco developed a wrapper to run the Online version on a users&#39; own computer via docker containers.</p><p>Funded by:</p><a href="https://ldaca.edu.au" target="_blank"><img src="'+c+'" class="h-32"></a><h2 id="june-to-december-2022" tabindex="-1">June to December 2022 <a class="header-anchor" href="#june-to-december-2022" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;June to December 2022&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By this time, difficulties using the Online version in external applications (Sciebo RDS and the Nyingarn Workspace) were evident. The Sciebo team were managing their own fork so that they could customise it to suit their environment and Marco was finding it difficult to synchronise the Describo internal state with the Nyingarn internal state.</p><p>Given these issues, and with support from the Nyingarn Project, Marco conceptualised and developed the crate builder component as a plugin that developers could use in their own applications. In short, the RO Crate engine internal to Describo Online was extracted into a standalone VueJS component others could use in their applications and customise without needing to fork the whole environment or run what had become an overly complex environment. As a tool trying to be all things to all groups (via the design requirement to talk to various storage backends) Describo online was already showing signs of significant technical debt.</p><p>During the year, Marco was contacted by the people at Sztaki in Hungary to talk about how they wished to develop an RO Crate capability in Dataverse using Describo Online. The standalone component developed by Marco in Nyingarn went on to form the basis of their work.</p><p>Funded by:</p><a href="https://nyingarn.net" target="_blank"><img src="'+t+'" class="h-32"></a><h2 id="_2023" tabindex="-1">2023 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2023" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2023&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After extracting the RO Crate engine into a standalone component, Marco was able to revive the Describo Desktop application as well as create a web based application for users who didn&#39;t want, or weren&#39;t able, to install the desktop version. The component enabled the development of different tools for different users, all with a consistent user experience. And developers using the component weren&#39;t required to deal with the technical debt inherent in the design of Describo Online.</p><p>This was also a key turning point in the direction of Describo in that it allowed users to decide how their environments should work without needing to accept compromises or decisions made by the Describo technical leadership. Marco designed all aspects of the component to be totally configurable so developers could decide how it looked and worked in their applications.</p><p>Around the same time, Marco registered the describo organisation in Github to pull together all of the related Describo developments including profiles and data packs. Marco also setup the profiles repository as a hosting point for domain specific profiles that the Desktop and Web tools could dynamically pull profiles from so users could get started quickly with definitions created by others.</p><p>Marco has continued contributing to the Describo environment as an open source developer when time permits. This includes maintaining the crate component (with help from our Hungarian friends at Sztaki), the desktop and web versions, profiles, data packs and this website. Marco is the current Technical Lead of the Describo Project.</p><p>Peter envisioned a tool that copies most of the Describo innovations but is architected differently and so decided to pursue that vision elsewhere using funding from the Language Data Commons Project of Australia.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Info</p><p>Peter has not been associated with the Describo project or any of its components since early 2023.</p></div>',32),h=[d];function p(u,b,m,f,g,w){return n(),o("div",null,h)}const D=a(l,[["render",p]]);export{y as __pageData,D as default};
